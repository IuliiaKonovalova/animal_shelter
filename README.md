​
### Bugs
+ ##### Solved bugs
    1. The testimonials pictures had a square shape in Brave browser on a mobile phone when the border radius had been set to 50%. It was due to the outline properties settings instead of the border
    
        *Solutions:* Outline was replaced with border properties.
    
    1. The gallery image descriptions were not appearing on the picture when hovering it as the position of the .image_content was set to fixed.
        
        *Solution:* The .image_content position was set to absolute, with the top: 0, left: 0, and added padding on the .image_content. 

    1. Footer on the contact page was reducing the size of the screen and shrank the contact form as the height of the background image was set to calc(100vh-the size of the footer)
        
        *Solution:* The height of the image was set to 100hv, and the display of the footer was set to fixed.
